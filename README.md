## To get started with this project, follow these steps:
* clone the repository git clone https://github.com/ElStabilini/optimization.git
* move into the optimization folder cd optimization
* install the required dependencies poetry install


  ### Note
  This project is based on an old version of the `Qibocal` library (`Qibocal` v0.1) because to efficiently run the randomized benchmarking requested for optimization we use [this](https://github.com/qiboteam/qibocal/tree/qua-cryoscope) branch.
